/**
 * Why Workers (pdf.worker.mjs)
 *
 * PDF parsing is heavy. Without the worker, the browser tries to do it
 * on the main thread and your app can freeze/stutter during parsing.
 * The worker moves that work into a separate thread.

/**
 *
 * How to use Worker (pdf.worker.mjs)
 *
 */

Files you need for the worker setup

1) src/assets/pdf.worker.mjs
  This is not code you write — it’s a copied artifact.

  Copy from:
  node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.mjs

  Paste into:
  src/assets/pdf.worker.mjs

  That’s the file pdf.js loads at runtime to do parsing off the UI thread.


2) angular.json assets entry

  Make sure your project is already copying src/assets (most Angular apps do). In angular.json:

  "assets": [
    "src/assets"
  ]


3) Your service: pdf-parser.service.ts

In pdf-parser.service.ts ensureWorkerConfigured() keep:

pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/assets/pdf.worker.mjs';


That line is what “connects” pdf.js to the file you copied into assets.
